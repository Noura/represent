Participatory Mapping for Agriculture,,y,y,y,ALBA_Berries.jpg,"Agricultural extension has historically been an expert led endeavor, where university scientists draw up improved farming regimens and recipes derived from controlled experimental plots. Inspired by the successes of participatory agricultural research, Iâ€™m interested in viewing extension as means to facilitate local farmer knowledge for improved decision making based on a diverse set of lived contexts. In particular, I hope to use participatory mapping technologies to engage small scale farmers in collaborative data collection for the purpose of engaging findings with regional policy makers.",Crowd-sourcing Land Access for Migrant Farmers
