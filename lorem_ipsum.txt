Functions in JavaScript are objects. Objects are collections of name/value pairs having a hidden link to a prototype object. Objects produced from object literals are linked to Object.prototype. Function objects are linked to Function.prototype (which is itself linked to Object.prototype). Every function is also created with two addition hidden properties: the function's context and the code that implements the function's behavior.
